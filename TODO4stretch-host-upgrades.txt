   │ The PostgreSQL version 9.4 is obsolete, but the server or client packages are still installed.     
   │ Please install the latest packages (postgresql-9.6 and postgresql-client-9.6) and upgrade the      
   │ existing  clusters with pg_upgradecluster (see manpage).

  │ Please be aware that the installation of postgresql-9.6 will automatically create a default        
   │ cluster 9.6/main. If you want to upgrade the 9.4/main cluster, you need to remove the already      
   │ existing 9.6 cluster (pg_dropcluster --stop 9.6 main, see manpage for details).

   │ The old server and client packages are no longer supported. After the existing clusters are        
   │ upgraded, the postgresql-9.4 and postgresql-client-9.4 packages should be removed.    

   │ Please see /usr/share/doc/postgresql-common/README.Debian.gz for details.                          

-> didnt cleanup installed packages on jenkins just yet

pb10
----
had to apt install linux-image-amd64 should go in update_jdn and why is that even neccessary?

update_jdn.sh
-------------
refactor some apt-get install calls away (which used to be needed because of jessie-backports…)


open problems
-------------
- dsa-check-packages points to /bin/true on hosts running in the future
- compare sshd_config from stretch with the one we're using (from jessie)
- check "systemctl -a" for "not found" and failed services, like haveged…
	haveged not running on pb3+4+12, while running fine on 2+6+16 ?!???

no i386 kernels on i386
-----------------------
because of:
#866314: linux-image-4.9.0-3-686-pae: 100+ times slower disk writes on 4.x+/i386/16+RAM, compared to 3.x
amd64 kernel was manually installed with multiarch, should go into update_jdn
also on pb3+4+9 I had to do: sudo apt install linux-image-amd64


to be done once all hosts run stretch: squid
--------------------------------------------
It seems the squid configuration moved from /etc/squid3 to /etc/squid.  postinst
script takes care of moving the files, but we should eventually:
1) move them in our git repo too
2) delete /etc/squid3 from the hosts
3) install squid instead of squid3 in update_jdn (once all hosts are upgraded) - that's going to mark the package as manually installed
4) apt purge squid3

to be done once all hosts run stretch: sshd_config
--------------------------------------------------
/etc/ssh/sshd_config - the currently running one is the one from jessie, we should update_jdn to the one from stretch


done for upgrades
-----------------
all i386+armhf+amd64 nodes
