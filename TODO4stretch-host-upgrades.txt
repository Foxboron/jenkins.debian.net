- dsa-check-packages points to /bin/true on hosts running in the future
- compare sshd_config from stretch with the one we're using (from jessie)
- check "systemctl -a" for "not found" and failed services, like havegedâ€¦
	haveged not running on pb3+4+12, while running fine on 2+6+16 ?!???

no i386 kernels on i386
-----------------------
because of:
#866314: linux-image-4.9.0-3-686-pae: 100+ times slower disk writes on 4.x+/i386/16+RAM, compared to 3.x
amd64 kernel was manually installed with multiarch, should go into update_jdn
also on pb3+4+9 I had to do: sudo apt install linux-image-amd64

todo for upgrades
-----------------
test jenkins-test-vm upgrade before doing jenkins
	-> cucumber problems reported by fil


to be done once all hosts run stretch: squid
--------------------------------------------
It seems the squid configuration moved from /etc/squid3 to /etc/squid.  postinst
script takes care of moving the files, but we should eventually:
1) move them in our git repo too
2) delete /etc/squid3 from the hosts
3) install squid instead of squid3 in update_jdn (once all hosts are upgraded) - that's going to mark the package as manually installed
4) apt purge squid3

to be done once all hosts run stretch: sshd_config
--------------------------------------------------
/etc/ssh/sshd_config - the currently running one is the one from jessie, we should update_jdn to the one from stretch


done for upgrades
-----------------
all i386+armhf nodes
all amd64 nodes except jenkins and am64
