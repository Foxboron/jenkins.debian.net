open problems
-------------
- future hosts dont run in the future cause ntpd is running
- dsa-check-packages points to /bin/true on hosts running in the future
- resolve issues on pb2+6+12+16:
	no amd64 kernel for i386? manually done, needs to go into update_jdn
	compare sshd_config from stretch with the one we're using (from jessie)
- on pb3+4+9 I had to do: sudo apt install linux-image-amd64


todo for upgrades
-----------------
test jenkins-test-vm upgrade before doing jenkins
	-> cucumber problems reported by fil
wait with upgrading armhf nodes until next week as vagrant has no time until then


to be done once all hosts run stretch: squid
--------------------------------------------
It seems the squid configuration moved from /etc/squid3 to /etc/squid.  postinst
script takes care of moving the files, but we should eventually:
1) move them in our git repo too
2) delete /etc/squid3 from the hosts
3) install squid instead of squid3 in update_jdn (once all hosts are upgraded) - that's going to mark the package as manually installed
4) apt purge squid3

to be done once all hosts run stretch: sshd_config
--------------------------------------------------
/etc/ssh/sshd_config - the currently running one is the one from jessie, we should update_jdn to the one from stretch


done for upgrades
-----------------
upgrade of all i386 nodes
upgrade of pb3+4+9-amd64
upgrade of jenkins-test-vm in progress
