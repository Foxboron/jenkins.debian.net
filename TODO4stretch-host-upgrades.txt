rough notes from upgrading pb-build2:
--------------------------------------
check for changes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config - the currently running one is the one from jessie which doesnt 
seem sufficient anymore…

had to do "sudo apt install linux-image-686-pae", to get kernel upgraded… huh? :)
-> add multiarch, needs to be added to update_jdn still…

problems
--------
no amd64 kernel for i386? manually done, needs to go into update_jdn
pb6+16 are not running in the future anymore

todo for upgrades
-----------------
test jenkins-test-vm upgrade before doing jenkins
	-> cucumber problems reported by fil
resolve issues on pb2+6+12+16 :)
replace squid3 in update_jdn with squid - once all nodes run stretch
wait with upgrading armhf nodes until next week as vagrant has no time until then

done for upgrades
-----------------
base upgrade of all i386 nodes, still need finishing touches as described above
