rough notes from upgrading pb-build2:
--------------------------------------
check for changes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config - the currently running one is the one from jessie which doesnt 
seem sufficient anymore…

squid ok?

had to do "sudo apt install linux-image-686-pae", to get kernel upgraded… huh? :)


problems
--------
no amd64 kernel for i386?
pb6+16 are not running in the future anymore

todo for upgrades
-----------------
test jenkins-test-vm upgrade before doing jenkins
resolve issues on pb2+6+12+16 :)

done for upgrades
-----------------
base upgrade of all i386 nodes, still need finishing touches as described above
