# Running
# =======
# 
# Just start `./find_dpkg_trigger_cycles.sh`. It will do the following:
# 
# 1. download apt sources and apt-file data for the amd64 Debian
#     using $1 as distro and store them in a directory tree rooted at
#    `./debian-sid-amd64`
# 2. go through all binary packages which have a file `DEBIAN/triggers` in their
#    control archive (the list is retrieved from binarycontrol.debian.net)
#    and for each package:
#   1. download and unpack its control archive
#   2. store all interest-await file triggers in the file `interested-file`
#   3. store all interest-await explicit triggers in the file `interested-explicit`
#   4. store all activate-await file triggers in the file `activated-file`
#   5. store all activate-await explicit triggers in the file `activated-explicit`
#   6. remove the downloaded binary package and unpacked control archive
# 3. go through `interested-file` and for each line:
#   1. calculate the dependency closure for the binary package and for
#      each package in the closure:
#     1. use `apt-file` to get all files of the package
#     2. check if the current file trigger matches any file in the package
#     3. store any hits in the file `result-file`
# 4. go through `interested-file` and for each line:
#   1. calculate the dependency closure for the binary package and for
#      each package in the closure:
#     1. check if the package activates the current file trigger
#     2. append any hits to the file `result-file`
# 5. go through `interested-explicit` and for each line:
#   1. calculate the dependency closure for the binary package and for
#      each package in the closure:
#     1. check if the package activate the current explicit trigger
#     2. store any hits in the file `result-explicit`
# 
# Files
# =====
# 
# interested-file
# ---------------
# 
# Associates binary packages to file triggers they are interested in. The first
# column is the binary package, the second column is either `interest` or
# `interest-await` and the last column the path they are interested in.
# 
# interested-explicit
# -------------------
# 
# Associates binary packages to explicit triggers they are interested in. The
# first column is the binary package, the second column is either `interest` or
# `interest-await` and the last column the name of the explicit trigger they are
# interested in.
# 
# activated-file
# --------------
# 
# Associates binary packages to file triggers they activate. The first column is
# the binary package, the second column is either `activate` or `activate-await`
# and the last column the path they activate.
# 
# activate-explicit
# -----------------
# 
# Associates binary packages to explicit triggers they activate. The first column
# is the binary package, the second column is either `activate` or
# `activate-await` and the last column the explicit trigger they activate.
# 
# result-file
# -----------
# 
# Associates binary packages with other binary packages they can form a file
# trigger cycle with. The first column is the binary package containing the file
# trigger, the second column is the file trigger, the third column is a binary
# package providing a path that triggers the binary package in the first column,
# the fourth column is the triggering path of provided by the binary package in
# the third column.
# 
# result-explicit
# ---------------
# 
# Associates binary packages with other binary packages they can form an explicit
# trigger cycle with. The first column is the binary package interested in the
# explicit trigger, the second column is the name of the explicit trigger, the
# third column is the binary package activating the trigger.
