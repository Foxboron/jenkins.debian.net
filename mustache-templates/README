mustache is a templating language with the following simple rules.
The template accepts a "context" -- a python dictionary. Values can be
Booleans, strings, numbers, html, and lists of dictionaries. Empty stings,
None and False values are interpreted as false.

See complete description here: https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html

Syntax:
{{foo}}
	-> subsitute with the value of foo

{{#foo}}some html{{/foo}}
	-> if foo exists and it's value is not false, include "some html"

{{^foo}}some html{{/foo}}
	-> if foo does not exists or it's value is false, include "some html"

{{#foo}}{{^bar}}some html{{/bar}}{{/foo}}
	-> if foo exists and bar does not exist, include "some html"

{{#items}}<ul>{{item}}</ul>{{/items}}
	-> if context['items'] is a list of dictionaries, repeat the html between
	the "items" tags using each object as the context iteratively.

{{{additional_html}}}
	-> three "{"  must be used to pass html into a template
